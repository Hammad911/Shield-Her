# **App Name**: SafeZone

## Core Features:

- High-Crime Area Alert: Uses the browser's Geolocation API to determine the user's current location and displays a warning if the user is within a defined radius of a high-crime area.
- Simulated Gunshot Trigger: A large, clearly visible button that, when pressed, simulates a gunshot detection event.  This triggers an alert to be displayed to the user.
- Persistent Alert Bar: Displays a persistent alert bar at the top of the screen to warn users of potential dangers.  The color and message change based on whether it's a general high-crime area alert or a specific gunshot detection alert.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: White or light gray for the background to ensure readability.
- Alert colors: Use red (#FF4136) for gunshot alerts and yellow (#FFDC00) for high-crime area alerts to immediately grab attention.
- Accent: Blue (#007BFF) for interactive elements like the "Simulate Gunshot" button.
- Clean, minimal layout with a focus on mobile responsiveness. The alert bar should be fixed at the top of the screen.
- Use a clear and recognizable gun icon for the "Simulate Gunshot" button.
